## üìùDescription

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
Our idea ‚ÄúReachOut‚Äù aims to build a progressive web app that makes access for the specially abled to government schemes expeditious and empowers them
<br><br>
      The <i>key features</i> of <strong>ReachOut</strong>:

## üõ†Project Setup

### For the web-app

1. Clone the GitHub repo
   ```
   $ git clone https://github.com/saRvaGnyA/ReachOut-SIH-Prototype.git
   ```
2. Enter the `client` directory. Install all the required dependencies. Ensure that remove any globally-installed packages like the React CLI, Tailwind CLI, PostCSS CLI or ESLint are uninstalled before proceeding ahead
   ```
   $ cd client
   $ yarn add
   ```
3. Setup the `.env.local` file for storing the environment variables. A demo file for this is as follows:
   ```
   HASURA_ADMIN_SECRET = your hasura admin key
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY = your supabase anon key
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL = your supabase public url
   ```
4. If you are working on Visual Studio Code or WebStorm, it'd be convenient to install the extensions for [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) and [ESLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint).

## üíªUsage

Once the required setup and installation is completed, you can start developing and running the project.

### For the web-app

1. Go to the `client` directory and run the `dev` script to activate the development server
   ```
   $ npm run dev
   ```
   Before pushing any commit, make sure to run the `lint` script and fix any linting errors
   ```
   $ npm run lint
   ```
   If you get an ESLint, Tailwind or PostCSS version conflict error, make a `.env` file in the `client` directory with the following contents:
   ```
   SKIP_PREFLIGHT_CHECK = true
   ```
